        <div class="about-header down20"><img class="about-icons" src="img/student.png">Who Are We?</div>
      <p class="about-content">Scriblr is an startup based in India, founded by passionate college students. The core team consists of writers and developers who understand the millenial generation and how they think. We've come together to change how you read books. We're based in Pune, although we have volunteers helping out from all over the country. The goal by the time we launch is to have a reach not only across India, but across United States, Europe and other major markets for content and literature consumption. </p>


      <div class="about-header"><img class="about-icons" src="img/books.png">Why Scriblr?</div>
    <p class="about-content">Storytelling and literature have been at the heart of modern entertainment for years. Despite the the 2000's being the decade where technology truly swept across industries, literature has remained relatively untouched. This is why we built Scriblr: a new app for fiction designed for the modern reader. </p>
    
    <div class="about-header"><img class="about-icons" src="img/icon.png">The Basics</div>
    <p class="about-content">On Scriblr you can read and write your own stories as part of a vibrant community, while also reading Scriblr Originals. Originals are stories commisioned by the company by writers we select and scout. We want to provide the perfect balance between community stories and commissioned stories to ensure that there is always something for you to read from your favorite genres and authors. </p>
    
    <div class="about-header"><img class="about-icons" src="img/settings.png">How It Works</div>
    <p class="about-content">Using a freemium model, writers on Scriblr can earn an income from their work from advertisements as well as user engagement on the website. Writers selected to create Scriblr Originals, will be paid upfront while getting additional incentives based on their views and user engagement.</p>
    
    <div class="about-header"><img class="about-icons" src="img/coding.png">What Sets Us Apart</div>
    <p class="about-content">Scriblr has planned multiple formats to provide content which will each radically change the user experience while reading stories. Interactive Storytelling, Augmented Reality, Multiplayer are all formats which have been designed carefully keeping in mind the likes and dislikes of the modern reader. One of our basic formats is Episodic Fiction, where series are released episodically with bite-sized episodes allowing for an enhanced reader experience. We want to change the way you read stories, and the way books are presented and we've designed the formats to make that happen. </p>
    
    <div class="about-header"><img class="about-icons" src="img/crystal-ball.png">The Future</div>
    <p class="about-content">Our team has come together to build a new entertainment company to pave the way to change the way literature and stories are both created and consumed. We have multiple formats planned for the future delving into Machine Learning, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality along with our other expansions. The Goal is to create an engaging environment where content creators can thrive and earn in a vibrant community. For Readers, to become the one stop for entertainment and stories on the internet. </p>
