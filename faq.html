     <div class="faq-header">For Writers</div>
      <div class="faq-question"> Q: How does it work for a community writer?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: As a community writer you will be able to create your stories on the platform itself in an on-website editor and continually update them according to your own schedule. Once you hit a basic rolling benchmark which combines basic statistics Likes and Views, you are able to monetize your work.</div>

      <div class="faq-question"> Q: How does it work for an Originals writer?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: As an Originals writer, you will work alongside Scriblr to create stories. We will work together crafting plots, characters and worlds to ensure that the best version of your story is released to the public. We will create a special illustrated cover for your story, and edit your story. As an Original writer, you don't depend on the statistics of your story to earn money, instead you get paid upfront for your view with additional incentives based on how your story performs on the website.</div>

      <div class="faq-question"> Q: Who holds the rights to my work in both cases?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: In both cases, you own the rights to your work. As a community writer you are free to do whatever you please with your work at any time. This differs from Originals writers where if you choose to write a Scriblr Original for us, you will agree to give us exclusive rights to publish your story for the next twelve months. After that time has lapsed, we will either re-negotiate with you to keep your story on the website, or you are free to take your story and pursue other publishing avenues. Any design or editing you got from us during that one year can also be used by you if you choose to leave us after a year. </div>

      <div class="faq-question"> Q: I'm a writer, how can I apply to work with you?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: You could drop us an email at the ID mentioned on our website with some specifics of format, genre, as well as some sample work you've written before. </div>

      <div class="faq-header">For Readers</div>

      <div class="faq-question"> Q: When are you scheduled to launch?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: We're hoping to launch around Q4 2018 as long as there are no further delays.</div>

      <div class="faq-question"> Q: Which formats will be available at launch?</div>
      <div class="faq-answer">A: We're doing our best to make as many formats a reality before launch. However due to limited manpower as well as time constraints, and to ensure that we can launch as soon as possible, we will be launching with Episodic Fiction and Interactive Fiction. We've been working on Audio and Video for a while now, and they should be ready soon after launch in a few months. </div>
