			Scriblr is a startup based in India, founded by a group of passionate college students. Our core team consists of writers and developers who understand the millenial generation and how it thinks, and knows what this generation of storytellers needs through personal experience. We've come together to change how you read and write stories. We're based in Pune, although we have volunteers helping out from all over the country. The goal by the time we launch is to have a reach not only across India but across the United States, Europe and other major markets for content and literature consumption.
